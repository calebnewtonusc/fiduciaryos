"""
discovery/enforcement_actions.py — FINRA/SEC enforcement action corpus builder.

Enforcement actions are the most valuable training data for FiduciaryOS:
they represent ground-truth fiduciary violations with expert (SEC/FINRA)
annotations of what went wrong and why it violated the fiduciary duty.

Sources:
  1. SEC Litigation Releases (www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases)
  2. SEC Administrative Proceedings (investment adviser cases)
  3. FINRA Disciplinary Actions (www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement)
  4. FINRA AWC (Acceptance, Waiver and Consent) agreements

Each enforcement action is converted to a training pair:
    input:  "Here is a description of an adviser's actions..."
    output: "These actions violate fiduciary duty because... The specific
             violations are: [1] ... [2] ... The appropriate action would
             have been: ..."

Target: 105,000+ violation-explanation pairs (30% of total training corpus).

Usage:
    crawler = EnforcementActionCrawler(output_dir="data/raw/enforcement")
    crawler.crawl_sec_lit_releases(max_releases=3000)
    crawler.crawl_finra_actions(max_actions=5000)

synthesis/fiduciary_pairs.py — Curated fiduciary training pair templates.

This module provides hand-crafted, high-quality training pair templates that
seed the bulk synthesizer. Unlike auto-generated pairs, these are:
  - Verified for legal accuracy
  - Diverse across scenario types and client profiles
  - Balanced across complaint (positive) and violation (negative) examples
  - Suitable for DPO preference pairs (chosen vs rejected)

Use these as quality anchors when evaluating bulk synthesis output.

These 50 templates represent the "gold standard" — the synthesis engine
is expected to match this quality level for the full 350k corpus.
